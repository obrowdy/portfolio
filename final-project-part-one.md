# Final Project Part One
## Outline
To complete this project I will be looking at diversity of programming in orchestras over time 

## Initial Sketches

## The Data
The raw data I plan to use to complete this project is from the New York Philharmonic archives. They provide public data containing information on decades worth of subscriber, orchestra member, and program data. I will use program data covering a handful of years between 1842 and 2022 to look for trends in programmed works by living composers, female composers, and composers of color. I will also look for trends over time in gender composition of the orchestra musicians and compare this to known dates of interventions such as blind auditions. 

I will also be suplimenting this data set with figures and statistics from public reports by the Sphninx Organization, the American League of Orchestras, and the National Association for Music Education. This supplimentary data will help fill gaps in the context of the New York Phil's archive data and help tell the story of how representation and education can make a difference in the progress and diversity of professional programs.
