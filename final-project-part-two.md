# Final Project Part 2
In this part of the project I used wireframes and storyboarding to retrieve feedback on my designs. I identified my target audiences, interviwees, and scripted an interview.  

## Wireframes used to complete this part of the project

## Target audience

My target audience includes current musicians, music educators, and arts administrators. These are the stakeholders with the most direct influence on the situation the data identifies. My call to action is that more equitable practices in auditioning and hiring, and more representation on the stage and in classrooms can lead to more impactful, diverse, and inclusive programming. 
  
## Approach to identifying representative individuals to interview

My approach to identifying representative individuals begins with finding individuals who have roles and interests including or similar to those of the target audience. That would be anyone working to produce, teach, or perform music. The next step is to find individuals with varying age ranges, levels of education, and specific professional roles. If possible, I also look for individuals with varying levels of involvement in diversity advocacy to help identify if the materials are meaningful to both those who are very interested and also those who may not be interested in the raw data. Other potential interviewees include those unrelated to the target audience to compare perspectives. At this point potential interviewees have been identified.

## Interview Script

*Thank you for joining me today. I am excited to hear any feedback you have for me. I will be walking you through a few sketches in chronological order based on the data set I have been working with. I will be asking questions about what you notice and what the meaning of each sketch is to you. This interview should take about ten minutes.*


**Questions for feedback:**
