# Critique by Design
![data project maybe](data project maybe.png)
I chose to redesign this visualization because the content is relevant to my interests and future work. The visualization comes from a report by Americans for the Arts in 2016 on a study of the National Arts Index. (https://www.americansforthearts.org/sites/default/files/NAI%202016%20Final%20Web%20Res.042216.pdf) As an arts manager, it is my job to be able to advocate for the arts within my own organization as well as with funders and lawmakers. This visualization is derived from very useful data, but does not do the best job at expressing its meaning and usefulness to the audience. 

I first criticued the original visualization using Frew's Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile. This lead me to find that the data presented in the chart is clear and meaningful, but that the chart is not aesthetically pleasing and does not do a goo djob of providing context to the data. The primary audience for this tool is managers and executives within the arts. The visualization is not effective for reaching the audience because it does not do enough to provide context and be talked about and shared without the accompanying report.
