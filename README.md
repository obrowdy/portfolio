# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU! This is a portfolio to publicly display all of the work I do in class.  

# About me
Hello! My name is Olivia and I am currently a second year Master of Arts Management candidate at Carnegie Mellon University. I use she/her pronouns and come from a background of music performance. I also love learning about color theory, topography, and design.

# What I hope to learn
All the things - obviously. Maybe I want to make a list of all the things.  If so, I can do so in Markdown like this: 

1. List item #1
2. List item #2
3. List item #3

or...

- List item #1
- List item #2
- List item #3

# Portfolio

# Examples
You can keep this section for stuff from in-class demos or your other work, or remove it.
