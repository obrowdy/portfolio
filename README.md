# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU! This is a portfolio to publicly display all of the work I do in class.  

# About me
Hello! My name is Olivia and I am currently a second year Master of Arts Management candidate at Carnegie Mellon University. I use she/her pronouns and come from a background of music performance. I also love learning about color theory, typography, and design.

# What I hope to learn
I want to learn how to use more advanced tools for creating data visualization. I also want to learn more about designing compelling and effective data visualizations that are able to tell the story of the data and convince audiences of its importance. I hope to use these skills in the future when presenting information to the business-minded Boards of Directors of artistic organizations to help everyone to be on the same page about decision making and conduct actionable change for the better.
